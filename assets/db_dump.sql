I want to transfer schools and I want to be sure the school I transfer to has a good sense of community because yes I know Iâ€™m bound to feel isolated for a little while at a new school but I donâ€™t want that to be the whole vibe and experience of the school.\n\nPros:\n\nDalhousie has marine biology and oceanography two programs that Iâ€™m interested in, as well as arts, that I want to have available as a second major option so I can do wildlife photography and videography after I graduate. Dalhousie is one of the best marine science schools in the country, field work and research on campus.\n\nQueens is in province, has a great geological science department. It is also known to be great for undergrad experience. I know a lot of people at the school, easier transition after transferring.\n\nCons:\n\nI donâ€™t really know anyone at Dalhousie and itâ€™s a different province I donâ€™t know what to expect. Although this could be a good thing because it would be a new unknowing experience. Housing crisis in Halifax. Price of flights.\n\nQueens doesnâ€™t have a marine science department even though they are next to water. They do have great research at the school, but not comparable to Dalhousie. Queens is also cutting back in their arts departments. They may no longer have fine arts but, they still have film studies.\n\nI would be interested in finding out more about both schools and experiences that other people have had at these schools!!\n\nThanks ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dalhousie/comments/1bzgpfq/queens_vs_dalhousie/, accessed on November 28, 2024.'),

If it helps any, for context I am an international IB student who\'ll probably be applying to Commerce - Accounting.\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dalhousie/comments/105vp5h/honest_thoughts_as_a_student_what_do_you_think_of/, accessed on November 28, 2024.'),
